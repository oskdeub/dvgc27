Creating an effective cheat sheet involves condensing information into keywords and phrases that trigger broader understanding of the topics. Based on the three exam papers, here are some suggested topics and keywords to include on your cheat sheet:

**Machine Learning Basics:**
- **Confusion Matrix**: TP, TN, FP, FN, Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- **Data Splits**: Training, Validation, Test - purposes and ratios
- **Biases**: Overfitting, Regularization (L1/L2), Dropout, Early Stopping
- **Evaluation**: ROC-AUC, Cross-Validation, Learning Curves

**Deep Learning Practice:**
- **PyTorch**: Tensors, Autograd, GPU Acceleration
- **Data Augmentation**: item_tfms (Resize), batch_tfms (aug_transforms, size, min_scale)
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - Batch Size: Stability vs. Memory Trade-off
  - Learning Rate: Finder Techniques, Schedules
  - Epochs: Early Stopping Criterion
- **Fastai**: DataBlock API, Learner, fine_tune, lr_find

**Deep Learning Theory:**
- **CNN Components**: Convolution (Filter Size, Padding, Stride), Pooling, Fully Connected
- **ResNets**: Skip Connections, Avoiding Vanishing Gradients
- **Activation Functions**: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Softmax
- **Generative Networks**: GANs, Autoencoders
- **Gradient Issues**: Exploding/Vanishing Gradients, Gradient Clipping

**Classical Machine Learning:**
- **Random Forest**: Bagging, Feature Randomness, OOB Error
- **Clustering**: K-means Algorithm, Elbow Method, Silhouette Score
- **Bias-Variance Trade-off**: Ensemble Methods, Boosting vs. Bagging

**General Concepts:**
- **Overfitting**: Signs, Solutions (e.g., cross-validation, regularization)
- **Optimization**: Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adam
- **Model Evaluation**: Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, Precision-Recall Curve
- **Statistics**: Mean, Median, Mode, Variance, Standard Deviation

**Formulas and Equations:**
- Precision: \( \frac{TP}{TP + FP} \)
- Recall: \( \frac{TP}{TP + FN} \)
- F1 Score: \( 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}} \)
- Learning Rate Update: \( W_{new} = W - \eta \cdot \nabla_{W}L \)
- Convolution Output Size: \( O = \frac{W - K + 2P}{S} + 1 \) (Where \( O \) is output size, \( W \) is input size, \( K \) is filter size, \( P \) is padding, \( S \) is stride)

**Additional Tips:**
- Write down any specific algorithms or methods that you had trouble remembering during your studies.
- Include shorthand for common processes or steps in algorithms that will help you remember the sequence of operations.
- Make sure to write clearly and organize the cheat sheet in a way that is easy to navigate during the exam.

Remember, the cheat sheet is there to help jog your memory, so focus on including the information you think you're most likely to forget or concepts you find challenging.
